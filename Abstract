Wine preference prediction involves classifying wine samples based on sensory data into quality 
categories, a challenging task that we explored using the wine dataset from the UCI Machine 
Learning Repository. This dataset comprises attributes derived from physicochemical tests on 
wines. Our study employed five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree 
(DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). 
Each model was trained and evaluated to determine its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, 
with hyperparameter tuning optimizing each model's performance. Our results indicate that 
ensemble methods like Random Forest generally provided superior performance compared to 
individual models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. Random Forest's ability to 
handle feature interactions and reduce overfitting contributed to its robustness. The Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) also demonstrated high accuracy, particularly with a well-chosen kernel, 
but required significant computational resources for training. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), while 
simpler and easier to interpret, offered competitive results when the optimal number of neighbors 
was chosen. Logistic Regression, despite being a linear model, showed robust performance and 
interpretability, making it useful for understanding the impact of individual features. Through 
comparative analysis, this study highlights the strengths and limitations of each technique in the 
context of wine preference prediction. Logistic Regression provided strong baseline performance 
and interpretability, Decision Trees offered easy visualization but were prone to overfitting, 
Random Forest mitigated overfitting and improved accuracy, KNN was effective with proper 
parameter tuning, and SVM excelled in accuracy at the cost of computational efficiency. These 
findings can guide oenologists and data scientists in selecting appropriate models for predicting 
wine quality, ultimately aiding in quality control and product development in the wine industry.
